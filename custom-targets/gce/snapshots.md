# GCE Custom Target Sample - Project Snapshot and Next Steps

This document provides a comprehensive snapshot of the current development progress for the GCE custom target sample and outlines the remaining tasks. The goal is to provide enough context for another LLM model to continue the work.

## High-Level Summary

The project's objective is to create a new Cloud Deploy custom target for deploying applications to Google Compute Engine (GCE), following the provided high-level design document. The core logic for the custom target deployer has been implemented in Go, along with a quickstart sample, build scripts, and documentation. The deployer can handle both standard and canary deployments, but the final cleanup step for old resources still needs to be implemented.

The design document can be found at `[GCE Runtime High-level Design.md](GCE%20Runtime%20High-level%20Design.md)`.

## Detailed Progress Breakdown

### 1. `gce-deployer` Application

The core of the custom target is a Go application responsible for rendering and deploying GCE resources.

-   **`main.go`**: Serves as the application's entry point. It determines whether the incoming request is for a `render` or `deploy` action and routes it to the appropriate handler. It also initializes the necessary clients (GCS, GCE).

-   **`deploy.go`**: Handles the `deploy` action.
    -   It parses the hydrated `InstanceGroupManager` and `BackendService` manifests.
    -   It implements the main deployment workflows:
        -   **Standard/Stable Deployment**: Calls `CreateMIG` and `UpdateBackendService`.
        -   **Canary Deployment**: Creates a canary MIG, updates a separate canary backend service, retrieves the URL map using `GetURLMap`, calculates the new traffic weights, and applies the changes using `PatchURLMap`.
    -   **Cleanup Logic**: Implemented the logic to clean up the old, previous stable MIG after a successful deployment. This uses the new `ListMIGs` method in the `GceClient` to find and delete stale resources.

-   **`params.go`**: Refactored the `params` struct to better organize parameters. It now has nested structs for MIG-specific and BackendService-specific configurations (`migParams`, `backendServiceParams`). The `determineParams` function was updated accordingly, and all files that consume these parameters (`deploy.go`, `gce.go`, `render.go`) were updated to use the new structure.

-   **`render.go`**: Handles the `render` action. Its key responsibilities include:
    -   Downloading and unarchiving the source input from GCS.
    -   Hydrating the `InstanceGroupManager` manifest:
        -   It substitutes the `instance_template` value if provided as a deploy parameter.
        -   It generates a unique name for the `InstanceGroupManager` by appending a suffix from the release name.
        -   It validates that the generated name does not exceed GCE's 63-character limit, truncating the base name if necessary.
    -   Uploading the hydrated manifests and the original source archive back to GCS.

-   **`gce.go`**: Contains the `GceClient`, a struct that encapsulates all interactions with the GCE API using the official Go client library.
    -   **Refactoring**: The code was refactored from standalone functions to methods on the `GceClient` struct for better organization and state management. All methods and the client struct have been exported.
    -   **Implemented Methods**:
        -   `NewGceClient`: Initializes all necessary GCE clients (for MIGs, Backend Services, and URL Maps).
        -   `CreateMIG`: Creates a zonal or regional MIG.
        -   `UpdateBackendService`: Creates a backend service if it doesn't exist, or updates an existing one by replacing the backend MIG.
        -   `DeleteMIG`: Deletes a MIG, with a pre-check to ensure it exists, making the operation idempotent.
        -   `GetURLMap`: Retrieves a URL map resource.
        -   `PatchURLMap`: Patches a URL map resource with a provided configuration.
        -   `WaitForOperation`: A robust method that waits for long-running GCE operations to complete, with a timeout.
    -   **Resiliency**: All API-calling methods use a `retryOptions` helper that provides exponential backoff for transient errors (e.g., 5xx server errors, 429 rate limiting).

### 2. Supporting Infrastructure

-   **`Dockerfile`**: A multi-stage Dockerfile that builds the Go application and copies the binary into a minimal `distroless` image for a small footprint and improved security.
-   **`quickstart/`**: A directory containing a ready-to-use sample, including:
    -   `clouddeploy.yaml`: Defines a two-stage delivery pipeline (`dev` -> `prod`) with a canary strategy for the `prod` target.
    -   `mig.yaml` & `backend-service.yaml`: Example GCE resource manifests.
    -   `skaffold.yaml`: A minimal Skaffold configuration that defines a public image as the build artifact.
-   **`build_and_register.sh`**: A shell script to automate the setup process by building the deployer image with Cloud Build and registering the `gce` custom target type in Cloud Deploy.
-   **`README.md`**: User-facing documentation explaining how to set up and use the custom target sample.

## Key Design Decisions & Refinements

-   **`gce.go` Refactoring**: The logic for interacting with GCE was initially planned as a set of standalone functions. This was refactored into a `GceClient` struct to better manage the various GCE API clients and provide a cleaner interface.
-   **Retry Logic**: A manual `RunWithRetry` function was initially implemented. This was replaced by a `retryOptions` helper function that leverages the more robust, built-in retry mechanism (`gax.WithRetry`) from the Google Cloud Go client library.
-   **`PatchURLMap` Logic**: The logic for calculating canary traffic weights was initially implemented inside the `PatchURLMap` function in `gce.go`. This was refactored to separate concerns: the calculation logic was moved to `deploy.go` (the "business logic" layer), while `gce.go` (the "API interaction" layer) is now only responsible for fetching and patching the URL map resource.

## Next Steps (Prompt to Continue)

The core deployment and cleanup logic for the GCE custom target is now implemented. The next phase of development should focus on ensuring the solution is robust and maintainable.

Here is the plan:

1.  **Add Unit Tests**: Implement unit tests for the key logic in `render.go` and `deploy.go`. This will involve mocking GCS and GCE client interactions to test the manifest hydration and deployment workflows without needing live resources.
2.  **Enhance Logging**: Improve the logging throughout the application to provide clearer, more structured output, which will aid in debugging.
3.  **End-to-End Testing**: Thoroughly test the quickstart sample to validate both standard and canary deployment scenarios, including rollbacks.
